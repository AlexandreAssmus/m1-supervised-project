# m1-supervised-project
The aim of this project is to explore how the advanced word embedding models can be linked to detailed lexical knowledge, especially as it relates to lexical theories. A key focus is on integrating these models with the principles of explanatory combinatorial lexicology from the Meaning-Text Theory.
